# new(Blog)

I always wanted to have my initials as my domain name and here we are: src dot onl! It speaks for itself ðŸ˜‰.

I also reworked on the format: blog posts will be shorter and more diverse. That will let me publish content more often.

## Technology stack

This new blog is written in Go, and blog posts in Markdown. I use Webpack to manage front-end dependencies. The code is visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/srchea/homepage).

Bonus: the blog is cookie-free, it doesn't use tracking or anything related.

Stay tuned!
