# new(Blog)

I always wanted to have my initials as my domain name and here we are: src dot onl! It speaks for itself ðŸ˜‰.

## New format and blog migration

I also reworked on the format: blog posts will be shorter and more diverse. That will let me publish content more often.

The most popular blog posts will be migrated from my old website.

 - [Build a real-time application using HTML5 WebSockets](https://src.onl/build-a-real-time-application-using-html5-websockets)
 - [Terrain generation: the diamond-square algorithm and Three.js](https://src.onl/terrain-generation-the-diamond-square-algorithm-and-three-js)
 - [Experimenting with Web Audio API + Three.js (WebGL)](https://src.onl/experimenting-with-web-audio-api-three-js-webgl)

## New technology stack

This blog is written in Go, and blog posts in Markdown. I use Webpack to manage front-end dependencies. The code is visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/srchea/homepage).

Bonus: the blog is cookie-free, it doesn't use tracking or anything related.

Stay tuned!
