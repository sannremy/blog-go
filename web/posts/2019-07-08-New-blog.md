# new(Blog)

This new blog is written in Go, and the content in Markdown.

I always wanted to have my initials as my domain name and here we are: src dot onl! And it speaks for itself ðŸ˜‰.

I also reworked on the format: blog posts will be shorter and more diverse. That will let me publish more content and more often.

Bonus: the blog is cookie-free, it doesn't use tracking or anything related. The code is visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/srchea/homepage) and runs on Google AppEngine.

Stay tuned!
